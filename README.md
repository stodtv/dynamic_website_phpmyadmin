This website was my final project for a Web development class.

To run this, i used XAMPP, as well as phpmyadmin. database setup file is included.

This website utilizes a more advanced design, as well as various operations with phpmyadmin.

NOTE: To allow an user to create articles, you need to rewrite it's "perms" column to 1 in the "uzivatele" table
